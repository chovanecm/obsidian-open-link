## Obsidian Open Link Plugin

This is very simple plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

It adds a new command *Open Related Link* which opens whatever url is specified as `link` in the frontmatter YAML

Example:

```
---
link: https://github.com/chovanecm
---

The content of your Markdown file
```
